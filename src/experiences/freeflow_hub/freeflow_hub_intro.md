## The new social media that empower people

With Social, benefit from a social media app that is built around you and not the other way around. The new social media culture that empower people and communities. 

## Features 

### Keep your data private

We don’t hold nor use your personal data. What's yours remains yours. You won’t see any ads of any kind nor censorship on Social.

### Define your circles

Define your audiences like close friends, other friends, acquaintances, or public, and define different levels of access to your profile, posts, and shared media.

### Trusted Recommendations

A recommendation from someone you know always beats an algorithm. With no algorithms nor tracking, you're now back in complete control of your social experience.

### Interact with real people

Honesty and integrity are core principles for real exchanges. It won't be possible to remain anonymous or to hide behind fake profiles on Social.

### A peer-to-peer community 

Unlike other social networks, Social won't have any centralization of authority and power. The community itself reviews its peers and information to build reputation, just like it should be in real life.
