"To meet" The "Ubuntu" philosophy found in many African cultures is based on the importance of community and mutuality - "I am because We are." Similarly, the Swahili word "kutana," that means "to meet, encounter or come upon," indicates a mutuality or reciprocity in that it is not one sided or in one direction. *[more info here](https://www.africaexchange.org/kutana#:~:text=%22To%20meet%22,sided%20or%20in%20one%20direction.)*
