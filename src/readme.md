Here you will find all the relevant information about the project.

## What is Digital Twin?

Digital Twin is a revolutionary digital avatar that will hold all of your digital life.

Today, our digital lives are scattered across a range of applications and services. Don't you think it's weird to be exposed to countless apps on our devices every day – apps that work in silos, complicating our lives rather than in conjunction? With Digital Twin, everything changes. Free yourself from the current application and advertising-centric system to a human-centric model with you at the center. One login and identity to access all your digital life - social media, communication, office, publishing tools, education, wallets, and more.

Digital Twin represents a definitive leap to true digital privacy, where only you can access your data and no one else – not even ThreeFold.
