# Digital Twin values




Our technology intends to promote SOVEREIGNTY, EQUALITY, SUSTAINABILITY whilst meeting this demand for decentralisation:

<br>

**SOVEREIGNTY**: A decentralized data economy has to be democratized, neutral and secure to provide sovereignty to all stakeholders and their data. Everyone shall be digitally sovereign and own their data just like they would own any other assets.

<br>

**EQUALITY**: A decentralised data economy needs to be peer-to-peer, available everywhere and owned by everyone – across geographical and cultural borders. Everyone (the “bankable” and the “non-bankable”) deserves equal chances to learn, partake and succeed in the data economy (also remotest areas of our planet, as currently half of the world population still doesn`t have access to internet).

<br>

**SUSTAINABILITY**: A decentralised data economy has to be environmentally conscious. All network, hardware and software components that constitute the digital infrastructure are optimized around energy-efficiency and carbon neutrality.
