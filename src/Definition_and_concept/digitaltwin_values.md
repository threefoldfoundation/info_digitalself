# Digital Twin values


Digital Twin is driven by three main values or pillars:

**Equality** | Equality is the foundation where everyone is given the opportunity to be empowered and to achieve full potential. The internet along its experiences should be inclusive to all of humanity. An internet which is peer-to-peer, owned by many, can be deployed everywhere, and accessible to all. 

**Autonomy** | Being empowered to learn, partake, dream and succeed is fundamental to achieve peace and fullfilment of humankind's potential. The internet should be responsible and democratized, respectful of individual privacy, neutral, and secure, and provide autonomy to all stakeholders. Everyone should be the owner of their personal data just like they own their experiences in reality. 

**Sustainability** | Ensuring the future of life on earth. It is about adopting the behavior and mindset to minimize our footprint. We need an Internet that is environmentally conscious, where networks, hardware and software components, as well as processes are optimized around energy-efficiency and carbon neutrality as much as possible.
