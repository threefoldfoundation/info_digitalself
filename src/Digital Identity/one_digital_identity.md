# One Log-in, One Digital Identity

Bother by unnecessary ads? Struggle to remember hundreds of password because the current system's infrastructure is not secured enough? Well, with Digital Twin, it's the beginning of a new and peaceful journey. 

## Multiple digital identities 

Digital Doppelganger refers to data collection and the digital realm, to the descriptive, collected data that companies store about us all. In other words, all those tiny bits of data, when pieced together, create a profile of yourself to indicates your political views, tastes, buying habits, sexual preferences, health data and much more. In fact, there are already hundreds or thousands of Digital Doppelgangers about you held by different companies and government. And we don't even know who are those entities.

These data are used to predict your behaviour, so they can target you with ads and "optimize" their products. However, most of the time, these data profiles are incorrect. Hence, you could see ads that you don't necessarily care about on social media or any other platforms.

## Multiple log-ins means multiple passwords 

With the expansive growth of online services has come an equal number of account details, we must remember. Many of us choose just to reuse a common password to make it easier to remember. Still, with our current internet infrastructure that is far from being a quantum-safe system, this is incredibly risky. Using the same passwords across multiple services means you are at a much higher risk of account compromise in our actual digital world. 

## Our data is stored in multiple places

It has been recently estimated that an average human leaves few gigabytes of digital footprints every day. Because of the centralized infrastructure, our data are stored in costly data centres all around the world. These data centres are hyper-scaled, not scalable and far from being sustainable.

## Digital Twin as part of the solution 

The era where we were in control of the data on our own computers has been replaced with devices containing sensors we cannot control, storing data we cannot access, in operating systems we cannot monitor, in environments where our rights are rendered meaningless. But now, Digital Twin is bringing a shift to this mess. 

It is time to regain power over our data and be the owner of our cloud. With our secured [Threefold Connect](threefold:tfconnect), you will need ONE log-in, ONE password, ONE authentification and you are in. With our [peer-to-peer system](power_of_p2p), connect, share and exchange with your family, friends, colleagues and community peacefully without intermediaries and fear of being watched. All your data will be stored in ONE place, and you will be the only person to have access to it. 

We believe that this unhealthy game between us and free apps has come to an end, and the you-centric app era has begun. With the different experiences, enjoy the feeling of being at the centre, surrounded by apps working for you and not the other way around. 

With Digital Twin, you are not the Product anymore.
