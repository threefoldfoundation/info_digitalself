### To buy TFT on an exchange, you will have to follow these steps:

2. Second, convert fiat currency into a digital currency that can be traded with TFT (BTC, XLM, etc. - depends on the exchange).
3. Third, buy TFT with the trade-able digital currency.

- First, exchange your TFT to another digital currency (BTC, USDT, XLM, etc.) that can be traded into fiat.
- Then, exchange the other digital currency (BTC, etc.) into fiat.
