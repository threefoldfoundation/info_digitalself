### Save the seed phrase in a safe place. In the future, 

**It may help to restore your wallet in case your device is lost !**

Seed phrases are required to restore your wallet in the unlikely case you loose your devices or access to your ThreeFold Connect App.

The seed phrase allows you to access and recover your ThreeFold Connect on any device. We highly recommend to write down your seed phrase on a paper (offline) and store it safely. The seed phrase is your only "key" to your Digital Twin and Digital Twin assets (not only digital currency but also all of the reservations, deployments and data storage on the peer-to-peer cloud). The Digital Twin Team won't be able to assist you in recovering your account as we do not have any access to your Digital Twin account or private data.

### IMPORTANT NOTES

> **Digital Twin does not have any access to or maintain records of your private key or seed phrase. It is your personal responsibility to keep your 24-word private key in a safe place.**

> **Do not share your private key with anyone, it is strictly personal. Losing your private key means losing access to your wallet and all your digital currencies including the Threefold Tokens.**

> **Anybody with access to your private key can take ownership of your ThreeFold Connect wallet and Threefold Tokens**

> **To access your wallet from another wallet (on another phone or online) you will need your private key (seed), without this private key your account cannot be recovered on another device or online wallet.**

Finish these steps and choose your new pin, then confirm it and confirm your email address.
