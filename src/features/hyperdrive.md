# HyperDrive

Is a colleage of IPFS but we believe it works better and more scalable.

The Digital twin adds following benefits

- data can never be lost
- unlimited scalability (can store petabytes)
- sync with other datasets e.g. automatic sync with your files on the [filemanager](filemanager)

## supported Features

- 2 way sync [DTFS](dtfs) with directoy into HyperDrive
- expose HyperDrive link for publish server
- link HyperDrive into filemanager (can be phase 2)
