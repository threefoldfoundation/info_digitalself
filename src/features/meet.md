# DT Meet

## Meetings

Have your personal or professional meetings in the most private and peer-to-peer way.

## Features

### Meet Privately

More than just an option, privacy is the foundation of how Digital Twin works. Feel safe to share the moments you care about with your family, friends, colleagues and community. Every call remains fully private to you.

### Be Together 

Have face-to-face conversations with an unlimited number of participants. From family meetings and group hangouts to yoga classes and business meetings – everything can happen on Video Calls without calling charges. 

### Built for Collaboration

Easily share information with screen sharing, record your calls to capture special moments and send documents without the hassle of email. Everything you need for online collaboration is integrated in your Meet experience.  

### Ultra-Secure

There are no ads, no affiliate marketers, nor creepy tracking on Digital Twin. Enjoy the most secure end-to-end encryption (powered by the open source Digital Twin Protocol) in the world.

### Available Now, Native soon

The first version of Chat is already available in its web-based version. But don't worry, we'll be going native in the upcoming weeks to provide you with a seamless experience.

## Multiplexing

The video app is integrated in the ThreeFold_Grid and will support Multiplexing which will improve bandwidth use in comparison to other applications.
