## Meet without boundaries 

With our Meet experience, achieve end-to-end encryption like never before with the first peer-to-peer video call application—scheduled personal and professional meetings in a most secured and private manner. 

## Features

Meet will be provided with the following features:

### Meet Privately

More than just an option, privacy is the foundation of how Digital Twin works. Share freely with your family, friends, colleagues and community, every time. 

### Be Together 

Have face-to-face conversations with an unlimited number of participants. From family meetings and group hangouts to yoga classes and business meetings – everything can happen on Meet without calling charges. 

### Built for Collaboration

Talk, video chat, record, share screens and files all in one place. There is no need to switch between platforms – everything you need for online collaboration is integrated into your Meet experience.

### Ultra-Secure

Enjoy the most secure end-to-end encryption (powered by the open-source Digital Twin Protocol) in the world. And a unique storage algorithm ensures your data can't be hacked or lost.

### Available Now, Native soon

The first version of Meet is already available in its web-based version. And we'll be going native in the upcoming weeks to provide you with a seamless experience!
