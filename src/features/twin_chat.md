# Digital Twin Chat

## Get back your personal conversations

Using the chat tool in the DigitalTwin, you can use real peer-to-peer communication to safely and privately interact with other people in the Threefold network. Your Digital Twin will be constantly online, saving your messages for when you will be available to read them. Expect the same experience as the best messaging applications out there, but with improved privacy, safety and ownership.

## Features

Our MVP version will be provided with following features:

### Private Messaging

Privacy isn't an optional mode, it's just the way Digital Twin works. No one can read your messages or listen to your conversations. Every message, shared file, or call remains fully private to only those in the conversation. So, focus on sharing the moments you care about with your peers!

### Stay in Touch With Your Circles

Circles represent the people you care about – your family, friends, colleagues or community. Share messages, photos and videos with an unlimited number of people at once. Name your circles, customize your notifications, and enjoy the journey!

### Exchange Freely

Experience crystal-clear voice and video calls with the people you love, without boundaries. Share text, voice messages, photos, videos, GIFs and files unlimitedly, without extra fees. 

### Ultra-Secure

There are no ads, no affiliate marketers, nor creepy tracking on Digital Twin. Enjoy the most secure end-to-end encryption (powered by the open source Digital Twin Protocol) in the world. A step beyond the "private" messaging apps which exist today.

### Available Now, Native Soon

The first version of Chat is already available in its web-based version. But don't worry, we'll be going native in the upcoming weeks to provide you with a seamless experience.

More features will be added in the future.
