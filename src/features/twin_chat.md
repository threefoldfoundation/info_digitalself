## Get back your personal conversations

Using the chat tool in the DigitalTwin, you can use real peer-to-peer communication to safely and privately interact with other people in the Threefold network. Your Digital Twin will constantly be online, saving your messages for when you will be available to read them. Expect the same experience as the best messaging applications out there, but with improved privacy, safety and ownership.

## Features

Your new Chat app will be provided with the following features:

### Privacy shouldn't be optional

Messages on Digital Twin are truly end-to-end. Only you can read your messages and listen to your calls, no one else - not even us.  So, focus on sharing with the people you care about!

### Stay in Touch With Your Circles

Circles represent the people you love or share an interest with: your family, a book club or a football club fanbase. No matter how big or small – create, name, and customize your circles on the fly. 

### Exchange Freely 

Experience crystal-clear voice and video calls with your people, without boundaries. Share text, voice messages, photos, videos, GIFs and files of any size, unlimitedly, and without extra fees. 

### Ultra-Secure

Enjoy the most secure end-to-end encryption (powered by the open-source Digital Twin Protocol) in the world. And a unique storage algorithm ensures your data can't be hacked or lost.

### Available Now, Native Soon

Early adopters will be #digitaltwinning with our web-based version. A native app will be rolled out in the near future for an even better and more seamless experience!

> More features will be added in the future.
