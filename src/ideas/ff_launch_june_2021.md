| find and buy product            | go to centralized marketplaces (like amazon), find what you need, pay too much, unsustainable for world, the small providers have no chance, you pay at least 3x too much. | find anything everywhere, no cost for interest or marketing, much more cost effective, know the source of the product/service |


Once fully operational, the impact is incredible and super disruptive

- no more banks or exchanges needed
- no more complicated IT systems needed
- no more facebook, whatsapp, deliveroo, uber, gmail, ... (no more need to be product)
- no more tax advisors, accountants, a lot less lawyers, ...
- no need for centralized media/communication/newspaper agencies

The core fundamentals of new global operating system

- no interest
  - no money out of nothing
  - much more sharing economoy (give first, get back alter)
- no locking
  - everyone can publish/sell/demonstrate everything to everyone
  - people don't get advantages to be part of a closed group
  - 100% trust model
- no marketing
  - marketing in current way not needed, replaced by reputation, trust, power of the network, ...
  - everyone can find everything (which is public, can be linked to topics) 

Result

- "mordor" cannot keep on growing, energy flow stops
- do realize this disrupts hundreds of trillions of USD existing business, so is dangerous
