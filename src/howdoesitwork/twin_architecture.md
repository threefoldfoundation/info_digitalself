Threefold Grid is a peer-to-peer and autonomous Internet Grid that provides game-changing performance and empowers new possibilities. With +500 servers delivering +80,000,000 GB of online storage across 110+ locations in 21+countries, the ThreeFold Grid is the largest peer-to-peer Internet in the world.

Digital Twin lives on top of Threefold Grid to deploy its solution. It is the architecture that is provide the possibility to 

The ThreeFold Grid is built by independent people that together create a pool of connected compute, network and storage capacity.

The ThreeFold Grid is made up of many servers we call 3Nodes that are distributed around the world by independent people and organizations we call Farmers. 3Nodes run a unique operating system called Zero-OS, a lightweight and ultra-efficient open source operating system. All 3Nodes connected to the ThreeFold Grid are registered in a database called the ThreeFold Directory, that registers the capacity available on the ThreeFold Grid Explorer. We call this proof-of-capacity.
