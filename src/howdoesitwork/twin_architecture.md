# Digital Twin Architecture

![](img/architecture_1.png)

Digital Twin lives on top of ThreeFold Grid which is a network of ThreeFold's 3nodes. Each 3node is autonomous storage and compute hardware that is connected to ThreeFold Grid. 

Architecture of DigitalTwin is based on ThreeFold's 3Bot, which is a backbone of it and manages all backend tasks for it.
