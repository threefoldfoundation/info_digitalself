# How Does It Work

In this section you can learn about some of the fundamentals how the digital twin works and how it is different any other solution out there.

DigitalTwin is a solution with some very unique [properties](our_vision).

DigitalTwin's unquiue properties are made possible by deep integration and smart use of the ThreeFold technology. We believe ThreeFold Foundation made a great job creating new type of architecture that enabled incredible new solutions to come live. We are proud to partner of ThreeFold Foundation and to pioneer this technology.

In order to make our vision possible, Digital Twin actively uses different aspects of ThreeFold technology and therefore in order to understand our architecture properly proper understanding of ThreeFold architecutre is needed.

There are multiple sources places where you can find information about ThreeFold, most up to date and correct is it's wikis:
- [General ThreeFold Wiki](http://wiki.threefold.io)
- [ThreeFold SDK](http://wiki.sdk.threefold.io)
- [ThreeFold Tech (Link is not ready yet)](http://threefold.io/info/tech)
- [ThreeFold Cloud](http://wiki.cloud.threefold.io)

Referencing to general understanding of ThreeFold Technology, we can explain how exactly Digital Twin works. 

To some degree Digital Twin works similarly to ThreeFold's 3Bot, and even more, it is based on 3Bot.
