### Private 

The current centralized infrastructure does not ensure the privacy of the users. Every time you send a message, that message travels to the data centre where the messaging application you are using is hosted - this applies to all centrally-hosted email, video, social media and search applications you are using. Therefore, this allows these companies to have unlimited access to your information.
