# Our digital Problem

> Image 

The urge for true decentralization in the data economy is manifesting itself in two ways: 
- Decentralization of the digital infrastructure in terms of ownerships and locality/distribution, and
- Decentralization of information in terms of ownership and privacy of information. 

## Decentralization digital infrastructure

In order to serve emerging digital workloads such as edge computing, IOT, 5G, AI, swarm learning, VR, autonomous transport, blockchain, and more, the world is in need of scalable, ultra-secure, and decentralized digital capacity everywhere, on demand.

Today, more than 80% of the Internet’s capacity is owned by centralized cloud providers. The capacity is derived from hyper-scale data centers - an infrastructure that is incredibly costly, not scalable and super unsustainable. As of today, the internet consumes about 10% of global energy resources.

We believe that centralization is the key problem of our actual unsustainable system. It concentrates on decision-making and operates as a transmission mechanism to transmit and amplify the effects of centralized decisions throughout the system. This means that when bad decisions are made - as inevitably happens in human behavior and nature - the entire system will be damaged. 

The current centralized infrastructure and system can also lead to unmoral activities such as mass surveillance that affects our human right, freedom and it enable significant power imbalances as well as damaging people’s autonomy and dignity. 

## Decentralization of information 

Digital Citizens, governments, policy makers, smart cities, indigenous tribes and municipalities are all demanding data ownership. The ability to provide data ownership to all parties involved while maintaining full regulatory requirements as well as security, scale & privacy is really important.

There is a growing global awareness of the value of our data economy and that ownership, privacy and sovereignty shouldn’t be negotiable. 

Have you watched The Social Dilemma and the Great Hack?

These documentaries successfully demonstrate how people are manipulated and targeted due to their social media platforms' activity or data. 

But something we need to agree upon. The internet was meant to be different. In the beginning, no one would own the internet. No one could own the internet. The internet belonged to all of us. We live in a technological miasma where beyond our control and comprehension, the internet lost its edge. 

It became about monetizing your clicks and swipes, buying and selling your data about your clicks and swipes, getting you algorithmically addicted to click and swipe some more—all of this to build up spurious advertising profiles about you. 

Do you remember when you could create your own safe space and decide what others see and know? Now, whether you are at home, in the middle of a city, or hiking a mountain, you’re never really alone. More and more, the technology we use today is connected to the Internet. Smartphones, TVs, cars, fridges and even baby monitors send out data about you and your surroundings 24/7 without your consent or control.

Think about the bigger picture. All those tiny bits of data, when pieced together, create a profile of yourself called your digital doppelgänger to indicates your political views, tastes, buying habits, sexual preferences, health data and much more. In fact, there are already hundreds or thousands of digital doppelgängers about you held by different companies and government. 

The reason is simple: predicting your behaviour and use it to their advantage. 

But this can change quite rapidly if we adopt a better architecture and model based on new [principles](values)

# We want change 

## Principles 

Digital Twin intends to promote Sovereignty, equality and sustainability: 

**Sovereignty** - a decentralized data economy has to be democratized, neutral, secure to provide sovereignty to all stakeholders and their data. Everyone shall be digital sovereign and own their data just like they would own any other assets. 

**Equality** - a decentralized data economy needs to be peer-to-peer and owned by everyone no matter the geographical and cultural borders (See more on Power of Peer-to-Peer). Everyone deserves equal chances to learn, partake and succeed in the data economy (also remotest areas of our planet, as currently half of the world population still doesn’t have access to internet along with its various experiences) 

**Sustainability** - A decentralized data economy has to be environmentally conscious. With Threefold Technology and its architecture allows us deploy our project while optimizing energy-efficiency and carbon neutrality. 

## One Digital Identity 

We live in an era where we have hundreds or even thousands of digital identities for companies to predict our behavior and to target us for unnecessary ads. A life where we are not in control of who has access to our data, manages, uses and stores it. But now, with Digital Twin solution, enter your digital world with one identity, one log-in, one password, one authentification and regain power over your data. 

With Digital Twin, you are not the product anymore.

## Peer-to-Peer as the solution 

Today, online privacy and security are badly compromised with this centralized architecture and the implication of various intermediaries. The exchange of real values becomes impossible. Digital Twin believes that peer-to-peer models is the solution to empower communities with equality, sovereignty, sustainability and resiliency. 

Digital Twin uses the power of the Threefold Peer-to-Peer Network to provide you with privacy, security while enjoying a seamingless experience.
