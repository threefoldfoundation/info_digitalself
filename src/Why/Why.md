# Our actual digital life problem 

![](img/Big Data is watching us.jpg)

Have you watched The Social Dilemma and the Great Hack? 

These great documentaries successfully demonstrate how people are manipulated and targeted due to their social media platforms' activity or data. 

But something we need to agree upon. The internet was meant to be different. In the beginning, no one would own the internet. No one could own the internet. The internet belonged to all of us. We live in a technological miasma where beyond our control and comprehension, the internet lost its edge. 

It became about monetizing your clicks and swipes, buying and selling your data about your clicks and swipes, getting you algorithmically addicted to click and swipe some more—all of this to build up spurious advertising profiles about you. 

## Centralization 

We believe that centralization is the key problem of our actual unsustainable system. It concentrates on decision-making and operates as a transmission mechanism to transmit and amplify the effects of centralized decisions throughout the system. This means that when bad decisions are made - as inevitably happens in human behaviour and nature - the entire system will be damaged. 


## Mass Surveillance 

Mass surveillance is indiscriminate surveillance. It uses systems or technologies that collect, analyze and/or generate data on indefinite or large numbers of people instead of limiting surveillance to individuals about reasonable suspicion of wrongdoing. 

It involves the acquisition, processing, generation, analysis, use, retention, or storage of information about a large number of people without any regard to whether they are suspected of wrongdoing or not. This tremendously affects human rights, our freedom, and it enables significant power imbalances as well as damaging people's autonomy and dignity. 

It creates an environment of suspicion and threat, which can cause people who are not engaged in any wrongdoing to change their behaviour, including how they act, speak and communicate. 

## Data exploitation 

Do you remember when you could create your own safe space and decide what others see and know? Now, whether you are at home, in the middle of a city, or hiking a mountain, you’re never really alone. More and more, the technology we use today is connected to the Internet. Smartphones, TVs, cars, fridges and even baby monitors send out data about you and your surroundings 24/7 without your consent or control.

Think about the bigger picture. All those tiny bits of data, when pieced together, create a profile of yourself called your digital doppelgänger to indicates your political views, tastes, buying habits, sexual preferences, health data and much more. In fact, there are already hundreds or thousands of digital doppelgängers about you held by different companies and government. 

The reason is simple: predicting your behaviour. What if they have enough information about you to predict your behaviour and use it to their advantage? 

**You need control over our data and data about us! control over who can generate it, collect it, access it and use it to make predictions and decisions about us.**
