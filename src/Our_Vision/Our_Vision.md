# How we see the world 

![](img/landing_header.png)


Imagine a world where the internet functions as how it was supposed to, where people enjoy their digital life in full security and privacy. A world where you claim full ownership and control over your data. An environment in which you live in full confidence and assurance of not being recorded or watched.

What if this digital life is waiting behind your door?

With our peer-to-peer Threefold Grid ("TF Grid"), Digital Twin declared that it is time for all of us to claim our freedom, our data ownership, our privacy, and digital security. With a you-centric approach, you will not be the product anymore - Actually, you will be at the center of your digital world.

Digital Twin sets the foundation for a new and better digital world and experience based on new principles:

**Peer-to-Peer**: With no intermediaries, consumers go directly to the source on the TF Grid. For example, thanks to 3Bot and the phone book,  two friends will be able to chat and call each other on a secure peer-to-peer application. Only they will have data about the chat and call, no one else - not even us!

**Decentralized**: The TF Grid's capacity is distributed across 20+ countries at launch. Digital Twin uses Threefold's decentralized architecture, which brings many benefits, such as security, cost-efficiency, sustainability, and much more. The expansion and reach to regions that need Internet capacity the most will be incentivized and/or sponsored by the Foundation.

**Autonomous**: Being implemented on the TF Grid, which is self-sustainable and self-healing, will allow our technology to be extremely resilient and enables data to be available even in the unlikely case on which data is stored goes down.

**Private & Secure**: By removing the need for human intervention, our technology eliminated many backdoors present in the current architecture. Combined with the peer-to-peer and autonomous approach, Digital Twin community benefits from an exceptional private digital life.

**Efficient**: Less is moreâ€”no need to have hundreds of different and separate applications. Digital Twin provides you with different experiences in one place.

**Equal**: Internet access should be available to everyone. The TF Grid solutions position themselves as the most affordable on the market. As mentioned above, the TF Grid expansion to remote regions of our world will be incentivized and/or sponsored by the Foundation.
