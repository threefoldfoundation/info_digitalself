# All integrated and connected to each other 

One of Digital Twin power is the connection between all the experiences and how they all work together perfectly. To illustrate it, we will illustrate the example of the John and Marie who wants to talk and collaborate with each other. This is done on the Digital Twin Portal. 

After granting each other access to their digital twin: 
- John and Marie talk to each other on Chat, all messages and data are stored in their own storage system. 
- John shared his holiday’s picture to Marie - Marie saves the picture and it is stored in her File Storage.
- Then Marie wants to speak to John on video calls. She can do it directly on the Chat app (No need to go on Meet tab). 
- Marie wants to record the video chat conversation. After receiving permission from John, the record is done and save in Marie’s File Storage. 
- Afterwards, John needs to collaborate quickly with Marie on a document. On the File Storage, he created an Office file and sent it to Marie where both can edit the document. The file will be saved on both Digital Twins’ File Storage. 
- Marie and John realized that the rent needs to be paid. On Chat, Marie gets access to her wallet and, thus, sends TFTs to John. John receive the Token and sends it to their landlord’s wallet who has also a 3Bot ID. 
- John wants to publish his holiday's picture on social media. He opens Social and post his picture, stored on his File Storage, on his newsfeed. 
- Marie wants to share a document with her professional circle. Originally stored on her File Storage, she post it the file on her Network's newsfeed, where she can grant access to colleagues to edit the document. 

The above example is a high-view on how all the apps from Digital Twin are connected to each other to facilate your digital life and journey.
