# Digital Twin

Digital Twin is a good use case on top of the ThreeFold_Grid.

Digital Twin is you as autonomous digital being on the grid which gives back the ownership of your data to only you – and no one else.

Digital Twin is a response to today's reality, your escape from the many popular centralized and often-abused applications used by a big majority of the planet. It grants you full access to a 100% neutral and decentralized digital life.

Eventually other experience providers will provide experiences on top of the Digital Twin e.g. the Crystal Twin (see alliance for conscious internet and TGP)

First implementation of Digital Twin (march 2021 in working prototype) has following features

- filemanager (manage all your files, photos, ...)
- office documents & collaboration
- video & audio conferencing tool
- chat tool (full peer2peer)
- web and wiki publishing tool
- peer2peer secure networking layer
